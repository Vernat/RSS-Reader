Yeat Another RSS reader
Hello!
It is my test task. It is raw, but enough for the task condition and check my some my programming skills. Allow to open rss news feeds, to switch between feeds,
to open links related to news in browser, to add new rss url, read/save rss url to settings. All background task are
running in background thread. 
I am ready to answer to questions if have them.

Thanks!
